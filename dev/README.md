# Welcome

This space brings together everything you need to integrate with ToS;DR or run our software yourself.

## What's inside
- [Self-Hosting Phoenix](self-hosting-phoenix/README.md) — current notes on deploying your own Phoenix instance, plus supporting material such as [useful SQL queries](self-hosting-phoenix/useful-sql-queries.md).
- [ToS;DR Developers](tos-dr-developers/) — API reference material for interacting with our public services.

## Get involved
We welcome improvements to the tooling and the documentation itself. If you already know your way around the project, consider [contributing](https://github.com/tosdr).
