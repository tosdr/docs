  In the context of artificial intelligence systems such as large language
  models (such as LLMs), we have established a policy to be followed internally
  and by anyone who wishes to contribute to ToS;DR.

# AI Policy

## Permitted use of AI

You may use AI tools for coding and for creating pull requests or patches across all of our codebases. Any such use **must be disclosed in your pull request**, without exception.

This requirement is not intended to shame or penalize contributors. Rather, it allows us to dedicate appropriate time to thoroughly reviewing and testing the changes, ensuring they behave as intended, are reliable, and meet our code quality standards.

You do **not** need to disclose AI usage when relying solely on code completion tools (such as GitHub Copilot).

**Rule of thumb:** if more than 20% of the work was generated by AI, it must be attributed.

## AI inside ToS;DR

We do not believe that large language models (LLMs) have a place within ToS;DR. Reviewing and interpreting terms of service and privacy policies is a sensitive task that requires careful human judgment and expertise. LLMs are prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies, which could jeopardize the reliability of our data.

We want our data to be as reliable as possible for our users, so we are not and will never be interested in

1. adding LLMs to our apps to summarize existing points
2. using LLMs to analyze policies

Any code changes that introduce or rely on LLMs for these purposes will be rejected.

## DocBot — our solution to AI-related challenges

Our team, primarily Evan Radkoff, has developed a specialized solution to address the limitations of traditional LLMs. DocBot is a purpose-built deep learning system that automatically analyzes policies and assigns points based on predefined criteria.

All outputs generated by DocBot are **always reviewed by humans**. Reviews are carried out by a small, trusted group of contributors with proven expertise in evaluating terms of service and privacy policies. This human-in-the-loop process ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability, while maintaining the high standards our users expect from ToS;DR.
